# OpenMPF Java Component SDK

Welcome to the Open Media Processing Framework (OpenMPF) Java Component SDK Project!

## What is the OpenMPF?

OpenMPF provides a platform to perform content detection and extraction on bulk multimedia, enabling users to analyze, search, and share information through the extraction of objects, keywords, thumbnails, and other contextual data.

OpenMPF enables users to build configurable media processing pipelines, enabling the rapid development and deployment of analytic algorithms and large-scale media processing applications.

### Search and Share

Simplify large-scale media processing and enable the extraction of meaningful content

### Open API

Apply cutting-edge algorithms such as face detection and object classification

### Flexible Architecture

Integrate into your existing environment or use OpenMPF as a standalone application

## Overview

This repository contains source code for the Open Media Processing Framework (OpenMPF) Java Component SDK, including the API and associated utilities.

In OpenMPF, a  **component**  is a plugin that receives jobs (containing media), processes that media, and returns results.

Using this API, detection components can be built to provide:

- Detection (Localizing an object)
- Tracking (Localizing an object across multiple frames)
- Classification (Detecting the type of object and optionally localizing that object)
- Transcription (Detecting speech and transcribing it into text)
